Initial release

____________________________________________________________________


Tips:

-> Please Bake the "Occlusion culling" and "Precomputed Realtime GI" before playing the Highdemo scenes.

-> Use linear Lighting for Dynamic look.

-> In this pack, Mobile demo uses Built-in mobile shaders!
I wouldn't recommend using PRB on mobile as there's no standtard PBR mobile shader for now. If you wanna use it anyway, u could find mobile pbr textures
(Temple of Ancient India\Platforms\Mobile\Textures\MobilePBR) within the project.

-> If you find popup's between LODS, add more light probes around the specific object.

-> Use lightprobes for small objects, it would reduce the lightmapping bake time.
